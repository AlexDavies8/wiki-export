# Wiki-export

This chrome extension allows you to export wikipedia elements as text.
Current formats:
- Markdown
- HTML

Currently Supported Elements:
- Infobox
- Tables*

*Advanced tables with subcolumns aren't supported as afaik markdown tables don't support this feature.

Planned Supported Elements:
- Figures

Feel free to suggest additional features/elements to support via Github Issues.

Once installed, a tools button will appear in the bottom right on any wikipedia page.
This will allow you to change settings or export an element. Once you've clicked a format,
simply select the element on the page you wish to copy.
